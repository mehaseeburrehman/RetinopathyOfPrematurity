AI-Driven Multi-model Classification System for Detecting Retinopathy of Prematurity in Infants

Abstract
Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a critical eye disease affecting premature infants, often
leading to blindness if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Current diagnostic methods are
limited by their variability in resources and expertise among ophthalmologists. In the case of
AI-based solutions, the focus is either on disease detection on a broader scale or on specific
isolated symptoms. To address these challenges, we advanced AI-driven system designed
to enhance the early detection and diagnosis of ROP through a multi-level classification
approach. This system leverages deep-learning algorithms to enhance fundus images using
image processing techniques, detecting and classifying key retinal changes such as abnormal
blood vessel growth and retinal detachment into types (Type-1, Type-2, and RD). This
innovation aims to bridge the gap in ROP diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings,
and support clinicians in making informed decisions, ultimately improving patient results and
reducing the risk of blindness in affected infants.
